## Android Game

### Please Read
This project was my first project in Java. I can say that I learned a lot from this project in terms of mistakes to avoid and the overall process of going from idea to execution. Since this was my first "big" project, there may be many shortcomings in terms of the code structure. Please understand that this is not a reflection of my **current** programming ability.
